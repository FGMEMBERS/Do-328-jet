Donier Do 328 Jet is a free and open source Dornier Do 328 Jet
airplane flight simulator project for FlightGear.

The goal of this model is to build a complete Do 328 Jet with a
reasonable flight dynamic model and most functions of the Honeywell
FMZ 2000 system.

The reason why IceGuye and Bo Lan intent to develop this aircraft
is not because it is popular or beautiful like many other jumbo
airliners. It is because it can land everywhere; it can do mid to long
range flight with optional tanks; its FMS system can be reused by many
other FlightGear open source projects such as the Citation X; it gives
you a plausible flight dream, which is more possible to touch such a
system rather than a jumbo airliner when your dream come true.
